DAY 03 --> Selenium Grid 


	JENKINS vs Selenium GRID ? 

		Jenkins       --> is deployment (CI/CD) tools
		Selenium Grid --> is for remote test execution 


	Q:  Is Using JENKINS the way to run our testcases ? 

	    YES 
			- JENKINS server resposiblity is managing deployment process (CI/CD).It is not the ideal solution 
			- If the company does not have any server to run testcases YES still we can use JENKINS Servers

				- If you run suites into Jenkins server it will consume resources from there.

		NO 
			- if the company has solution to isolate test case execution into another machine we will use that VM 	



	We need to find a solution for solving this issue	

		1. There can ready solutions
			- BrowserStack 
			- LambdaTest
			- SauceLabs
			- ... 
			- .. 

			NOTE : For this options you need pay as you used this server 

					- Video 
					- Good report 
					- Screenshot 
					- Different environment (OS , different devices, different browsers etc )	

	    2. Selenium Grid --> If you are using Selenium in your framework we can use Selenium Grid too 
	    	   			    Selenium --> Automation tools for browser 


	    	- Using Virtual Machines (VM) 
	    	- Docker --> Container engine 



---- How execution will happen with Selenium Grid ? 

		- Configuration.propertes file 
			browser=remote-chrome 

			remote-chrome will have all necessary connection information Selenium Grid VM to delegate your test cases execution 

		- When you run your code from Jenkins or Local depends on your browser type it will send your request to Selenium Grid machine.In our case it is remote-chrome and it will run into Selenium Grid Server 
		
		- if it is browser=chrome it will run int o local machine	


---- Where we are gonna get Selenium Grid Server IP addresses ? 
		
		- Ask your peers,qa lead or team mates to get this IP address to use in your framework. 

    ======= SELENIUM GRID ========

		SELENIUM GRID --> The Selenium Grid is a testing tool which allows us to run our tests on different machines against different browsers. It is a part of the Selenium Suite which specialize in running multiple tests across different browsers, operating system and machines.

		Simple Term --> is used to delegate test execution in another machines

		- We can connect multiple servers to do test executions.Servers can based MacOs, Windows, linux etc.Thus SG can support cross browser testing 

		Q: What is the diffence between local and SG execution ? 

			- Everyting is same only difference is test execution.Test executioin will happen into SG server
			- Still we are gonna get report etc 


		Selenium Grid has 2 main component 
			
			1- HUB 
				 - HUB receives request from driver then delegates nodes to do test executions 
				 - It works like Queen bee, manager etc 
				 - There needs to be only one hub 
			
			2- NODE	

				 - NODE isworker to execute test 
				 - There can more than one nodes for execution
				 - Woeker bees, worker etc 
		
		- HUB and NODE can be located into machine too 
		- Those should Java and browser (that you want)
		- HUB takes request NODE does execution 
		- We need to connecct HUB and NODE each other to distribute test cases 


		NOTE --> HUB and NODE is same file and this file has .jar extension 
				 When we are creating nodes and hub we will a role as NODE/HUB 

				 - selenium-server.jar

        

        WITH GRID 

        	Remote Execution --> DriverClass --> RemoteWebDriver --> HUB --> NODE --> Browser Safari
																	     --> NODE --> Browser Chrome
																	     --> NODE --> Browser Firefox 



        WITHOUT GRID 

        	Local Execution --> DriverClass--> WebDriver --> Browser 





        Q: 1 node to 1 browser?

        	It depends 

        		VM --> As a default 
        				1 node may have 5 Chrome + 5 Firefox + 1 Internet Explorer 

        				NOTE --> There is a way to change/adjust number of node 

        		DOCKER --> One has one browser 		


        Q: What is Selenium Grid ? 

        	- tool for remote, parallel, cross-browser , cross platform test execution 

        Q: Why we need ? 

        	- We dont wanna consume local machine resources.So we need to find a VM to do test execution
        	- To do fast 

        Q: Assume that George and Adam working  in same company(different team ).They want to do smoke test? 

        	- YES we can use same SG to do test executions with peers (same grid )

        Q:How many nodes you have ?

            - it can be 5,10,15,20 etc 
            - it is good to say 5 -10 



---- LINUX ---- 

- Linux is modular OS.It comes without UI. 
- It is faster than macOs, Windows etc 
- Couple of distrubiton ---> Debian, Kali, Ubuntu, Redhat 


Why companies using Linux ? 
	- It is free
	- Lightweight 
	- It provides SSH (Secure Shell )connection (more secure)

		- By default 22 port for SSH connection from Linux 
		- SSH use 2 keys 

			- private key --> gridserver.pem 
			- public key  --> gridserver.pem 

		- When you try to login it check your private key.If it is correct with public one it will give access
