Day 01 -- CI /CD 

	- Understand flow 
	- Create one instance Jenkins
	- Setup Jenkins
	- Create simple jobs (running our test cases in remote machine)
	- Take a report 



	Continous Integration  / Continous Delivery / Deployment  --> Kind of journey for applications 


	Why we are learning CI / CD ? 
		- To deploy application we need to make sure applications works properly 
		- We need to test to make sure application is working well 


	
	THere is a tool to handle/manage CI / CD process 
		- Jenkins 
			-- Open Source 
			-- Free 

			Another Tools for CI CD --> Github actions , TravisCI, TeamCity,Bamboo so on 


	VCS(Version Control System --> Github) --> TEST ENVIRONMENT 

		- Build 		---> It makes our application available as .jar file (ear > war > jar)
		- Code Anlaysis ---> SonarQube has integration with Jenkins to check code quality, potential issues ,security leaks and so on 
	
		- Unit/Integration -->  It is not our job.Developers will do it  
		
		- We are not gonna involve this process.It is good to know 


	TEST ENV -- STAGING ENV 


		- Smoke : 
			Application needs to be up and running 
			In a nutshell --> DOing knock knock 

			Example 
				-- It is not too much 10-50 
				-- It will take 10-30 mins  


		- Regression : 
			To make sure ENTIRE APP functionalities working properly 


		- Performance : 

			- It is good have dedicated ENV.Mostly they are using TEST ENV 
			- JMETER , LoadRunner,Gatling are popular performance testing tools 


		- Deploy : It will make available application for another environments 


	STAGING ENV - PRODUCTION 
	
		Staging -->Pre Prod.Just one step before releasing application 

		UAT --> It can be done from PO pr any other dedicated team 

		Release --> It is business decision to make application available for real users  	


PIPELINE 
	--> Pipeline is a set of processes that take the code from version control and compile, build, test and deploy to production in automated fashion.


	Q: What is JENKINS role in this pipeline ? 

		- Jenskins is tool to manage CI / CD Process 


    Q: Why we are using Jenkins ? 

    	- It is open source , free 

 	Q: Creating this pipeline is our job ?  
 		
 		- no we are just gonna involve this process.It is inevitable  	


 Continous Integration 

 	--> Continuous Integration is a process of automated build, unit testing, integration testing and code analysis.

 	VCS --> Test Env --> needs to automated. Rest of of them will trigger manually


 		--> Usually there is no func test.All test are doing for code level 
 		--> It is repetitive process to merge developrs code 
 		--> More bugs are caught/eliminated in this stage 
 		--> We are not involving this process (autmated stage)

 Continous Delivery 

 	 --> Continuous Delivery is an automated build and execution of at unit and integration tests, execution of code analysis, functional tests and also deploying to any supported platform any time. Each time a build or a set of code passes the tests, it’s automatically deployed out to a staging environment.


 	 --> In this stage all functioanal tests are triggered automatically (Jenkins)

    Q: Who is responsiblity to arreange triggers ? 

     --> DevOps

     --> If we following Continous Delivery still we need human intervention to release application 


 Continous Deployment 

 	-->  Continuous deployment means that every change that you make, goes through the pipeline, and if it passes all the tests, it automatically gets deployed into production.

 	--> When developer push the code all pipeline/cycle will start
 	--> If one of the steps fails , it will turn back to VCS (Version Control System)
 	--> So all the process will done without any human intervantion 
 	--> It is faster than others (Continous Integration / Delivery )


 Q: Who will do create this pipeline ? 

 	-> DevOps will do it 
 	-> Usually DEvops support multiple teams 


---- Devops 
	
	-- It is a culture or methodolgy like agile / waterfall 
	-- DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer ,System administrator 
	-- It is not like 3 in 1 man 
	-- Will write their scripts/code to create infrastructure	
	
	Q : What is infrastructure ?
		- It is everything about deployment process 

			- Database
			- Jenkins 
			- Server
			- Application 
			- Pipelines 



--- SERVERS

	- A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client.
	
	Pyhsical Servers 
		- This is a simple computer that is used for run software for server.
		- We have only hardware and there is no UI (monitors)
	

	Virtual Servers 	
	    - A virtual server is a virtual representation of a physical server. Like a physical server, a virtual server includes its own operating system and applications. These are kept separate from any other virtual servers that might be running on the physical server	



	    Main Types of Cloud Computing

	    On-Prem --> Server in your local.What ever you need you need to do it yourself 


	  	IaaS --> Server in AWS that we create is an example for IaaS (EC2 Server)

	  			 We have ready machine.We just need to install
	  			 	- OS 
	  			 	- Applications if we need data 
	  			 	- Run Time softwares 

	  	PaaS --> Platform as a Service 
	  	
	  			Get ready server to run your application
	  			You need toı install application and data if you needed 	

	  	SaaS --> Software as a Service 	 	

	  		 	It is ready for you applications.Application already installed 
	  		 	It is full service 



	  AWS Terminologies 

	  Regions --> Geopgraphical locaitons 

	  AZ      --> Data centers / buildings into regions.if something bad happens (tornado,earthquake etc ), other buildnigs will not gonna effect and server will continue to run 

	  EC2 --> Elastic Cloud Compute or EC2 is a foundational piece of AWS' cloud computing platform and is a service that provides servers for rent in the cloud.

	  AMI ( Amazon Machine Image )  --> EC2 + Operating System + Applications 

	  		  CydeoAMI 

	  		  		--> EC2 
	  		  		--> Windows 
		  		  		--> Java 
		  		  		--> Spartan --> 8000 --> API / DB 
		  		  		--> Spartan Auth --> 7000 -->  API / DB
		  		  		--> Oracle DB --> 1521 --> DB 
		  		  		--> HR ORDS --> 1000 --> API 


	
	How to create EC2 instance ? 


		- Launch instance 
		- Name --> My Jenkins Server 
		- AMI --> Cydeo + Hit ENTER --> Select CydeoLatestImage 
		- Instance Type --> It is t2 micro as default (DONT CHANGE ANYTHING)
		- Network 
				- Edit 
				- Create New Security Group 
					- Jenkins-Server 
					- Desc --> HR - Spartan - ORacle -Jenkins 

				- Remove Rule --> RDP --> 3389 
				- Add new Security Group ule 

					port --> 8081 
					Desc --> Jenkins 
					Source --> Anywhere 
						why anywhere --> it means we are able to connect that IP/application from enywhere 
						since our ip is dynamic it not suggested us 

        			Add other security rules based on their port number as we did in first security rule 

        - Storage 
        		- dont touch anything.As default it is defined as 30 GB 			


    NOTE : 
    
    	DONT FORGET TO ENABLE MFA ---> mehmet_only --> short video from AWS 		


    	Instance Status 

    		- STOP 		--> Close the server.It means still you have this machine but you are not using it.So you still need to 				pay 
    		- TERMINATE --> Releasing the machine.It means I am not usign this server anymore 
    		- START     --> It will start your server if you stopped it
